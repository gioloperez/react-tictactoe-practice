# About

This is a practice project and was based on the original React App Tictactoe tutorial (see https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe).
A different folder structure was applied on this project. This is the folder structure that I prefer and the app can surely work with other
folder structures that you prefer. Please use this as a reference only.
